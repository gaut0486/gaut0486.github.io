            <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>From a young age I was frequently found dabbling with technology, from personal computers to handheld gaming devices and everything in between. Throughout my life I have continued to dabble with technology in hopes of staying current in this constantly evolving industry, with a <strong>strong focus</strong> on smart home tech. I am beyond excited to be expanding my knowledge with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML.</abbr></p>
                <p>When I am not searching for and exploring cutting edge technology, I am often found tending to my <em>many</em> vegetable and flower beds, jogging around my neighbourhood, playing Overwatch on my Xbox, planning my many dream vacations, and most importantly playing fetch with my black lab Bailey in my back yard.</p> 
                <h3>A qoute that helps motivate myself on those days where it's hard to get out of bed. </h3>
